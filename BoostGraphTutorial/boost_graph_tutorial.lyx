\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is 'Boost.Graph Cookbook 1: Basics' (formerly: 'A well-connected C++14
 Boost.Graph tutorial'), version 3.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why this tutorial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I needed this tutorial already in 2006, when I started experimenting with
 Boost.Graph.
 More specifically, I needed a tutorial that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Orders concepts chronologically
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increases complexity gradually
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shows complete pieces of code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I had were the book 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "siek2001boost"

\end_inset

 and the Boost.Graph website, both did not satisfy these requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tutorial style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Readable for beginners
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial is aimed at the beginner programmer.
 This tutorial is intended to take the reader to the level of understanding
 the book 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "siek2001boost"

\end_inset

 and the Boost.Graph website require.
 It is about basic graph manipulation, not the more advanced graph algorithms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
High verbosity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial is intended to be as verbose, such that a beginner should
 be able to follow every step, from reading the tutorial from beginning
 to end chronologically.
 Especially in the earlier chapters, the rationale behind the code presented
 is given, including references to the literature.
 Chapters marked with '▶' are optional, less verbose and bring no new informatio
n to the storyline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Repetitiveness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial is intended to be as repetitive, such that a beginner can
 spot the patterns in the code snippets their increasing complexity.
 Extending code from this tutorial should be as easy as extending the patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the index, I did first put all my long-named functions there literally,
 but this resulted in a very sloppy layout.
 Instead, the function 'do_something' can be found as 'Do something' in
 the index.
 On the other hand, STL and Boost functions like 'std::do_something' and
 'boost::do_something' can be found as such in the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coding style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every concept, I will show
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a function that achieves a goal, for example `create_empty_undirected_graph'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a test case
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
test case
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of that function, that demonstrates how to use the function, for example
 `create_empty_undirected_graph_test'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
C++14 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All coding snippets are taken from compiled and tested C++14 code.
 I chose to use C++14 because it was available to me on all local and remote
 computers.
 Next to this, it makes code even shorter then just C++11.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Coding standard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I use the coding style from the Core C++ Guidelines.
 At the time of this writing, the Core C++ Guidelines were still in early
 development, so I can only hope the conventions I then chose to follow
 are still Good Ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
No comments in code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to add comments to code.
 In this tutorial, however, I have chosen not to put comments in code, as
 I already describe the function in the tutorial its text.
 This way, it prevents me from saying the same things twice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Trade-off between generic code and readability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is good to write generic code.
 In this tutorial, however, I have chosen my functions to have no templated
 arguments for conciseness and readability.
 For example, a vertex name is std::string, the type for if a vertex is
 selected is a boolean, and the custom vertex type is of type `my_custom_vertex'.
 I think these choices are reasonable and that the resulting increase in
 readability is worth it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Long function names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I enjoy to show concepts by putting those in (long-named) functions.
 These functions sometimes border the trivial, by, for example, only calling
 a single Boost.Graph function.
 On the other hand, these functions have more English-sounding names, resulting
 in demonstration code that is readable.
 Additionally, they explicitly mention their return type (in a simpler way),
 which may be considered informative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Long function names and readability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to my long function names and the limitation of ≈50 characters per line,
 sometimes the code does get to look a bit awkward.
 I am sorry for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Use of auto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I prefer to use the keyword auto over doubling the lines of code for using
 statements.
 Often the `do' functions return an explicit data type, these can be used
 for reference.
 Sometime I deduce the return type using decltype and a function with the
 same return type.
 When C++17 gets accessible, I will use `decltype(auto)'
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
decltype(auto)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If you really want to know a type, you can use the `get_type_name' function
 (chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:get_type_name"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Explicit use of namespaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, I am explicit in the namespaces of functions and classes
 I use, so to distinguish between types like `std::array' and `boost::array'.
 Some functions (for example, `get'
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
get
\end_layout

\end_inset

) reside in the namespace of the graph to work on.
 In this tutorial, this is in the global namespace.
 Thus, I will write `get', instead of `boost::get'
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
boost::get does not exist
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as the latter does not compile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Use of STL algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I try to use STL algorithms wherever I can.
 Also you should prefer algorithm calls over hand-written for-loops (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stroustrup1997"

\end_inset

 chapter 18.12.1, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "meyers2005effective"

\end_inset

 item 43).
 Sometimes using these algorithms becomes a burden on the lines of code.
 This is because in C++11, a lambda function argument (use by the algorithm)
 must have its data type specified.
 It may take multiple lines of `using' statements being able to do so.
 In C++14 one can use `auto' there as well.
 So, only if it shortens the number of lines significantly, I use raw for-loops,
 even though you shouldn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Re-use of functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions I develop in this tutorial are re-used from that moment on.
 This improves to readability of the code and decreases the number of lines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Tested to compile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All functions in this tutorial are tested to compile using Travis CI in
 both debug and release mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Tested to work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All functions in this tutorial are tested, using the Boost.Test library.
 Travis CI calls these tests after each push to the repository.

Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chapters of this tutorial are also like a well-connected graph.
 To allow for quicker learners to skim chapters, or for beginners looking
 to find the patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distinction between the chapter is in the type of edges and vertices.
 They can have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no properties: see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Building-graphs-without-properties"

\end_layout

have a bundled property: see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Building-graphs-with-bundled-vertices"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pivotal chapters are chapters like `Finding the first vertex with ...', as
 this opens up the door to finding a vertex and manipulating it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All chapters have a rather similar structure in themselves, as depicted
 in figure

Building graphs without properties
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boost.Graph is about creating graphs.
 In this chapter we create the simplest of graphs, in which edges and nodes
 have no properties (e.g.
 having a name).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, there are two types of graphs that can be constructed: undirected
 and directed graphs.
 The difference between directed and undirected graphs is in the edges:
 in an undirected graph
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
undirected graph
\end_layout

\end_inset

, an edge connects two vertices without any directionality, as displayed
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In a directed graph
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, an edge goes from a certain vertex, its source, to another (which may
 actually be the same), its target.
 A directed graph is shown in figure

In the process of creating graphs, some basic (sometimes bordering trivial)
 functions are encountered:

Algorithm

 shows how to add an isolated edge to a graph (instead of allowing for graphs
 with higher connectivities).
 First, two vertices are created, using the function `boost::add_vertex'.
 `boost::add_vertex' returns a vertex descriptor (which I prefix with `vd'
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
vd
\end_layout

\end_inset

), both of which are stored.
 The vertex descriptors are used to add an edge to the graph, using `boost::add_
edge'

 Here we assert

Graphs can have a hierarchical structure.
 From a starting vertex, the number of levels can be counted.
 A graph of one vertex has zero levels.
 A graph with one edge has one level.
 A linear graph of three vertices and two edges has one or two levels, depending
 on the starting vertex.

\begin_layout Standard
It does so, by collecting the neighbours of the traversed vertices.
 Each sweep, all neighbours of traversed neighbours are added to a set of
 known vertices.
 As long as vertices can be added, the algorithm continues.
 If no vertices can be added, the number of level equals the number of sweeps.
