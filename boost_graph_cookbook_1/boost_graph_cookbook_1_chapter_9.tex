\section{Storing a graph with a graph name property as a .dot file}
\label{subsec:save_graph_with_graph_name_to_dot}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This works:

\lstinputlisting[
  caption = Storing a graph with a graph name as a .dot file,
  label = lst:save_graph_with_graph_name_to_dot
]{save_graph_with_graph_name_to_dot.impl}
\index{Save graph with graph name to dot}

\section{Loading a directed graph with a graph name property from a .dot file}
\label{subsec:load_directed_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This will result in a directed graph with a name:

\lstinputlisting[
  caption = Loading a directed graph with a graph name from a .dot file,
  label = lst:load_directed_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot
]{load_directed_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot.impl}
\index{Load directed custom edges and vertices graph from dot}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Loading an undirected graph with a graph name property from a .dot file}
\label{subsec:load_undirected_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This will result in an undirected graph with a name:

\lstinputlisting[
  caption = Loading an undirected graph with a graph name from a .dot file,
  label = lst:load_undirected_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot
]{load_undirected_graph_with_graph_name_from_dot.impl}
\index{Load undirected custom edges and vertices graph from dot}
