\subsection{Edge descriptors}
\label{subsec:Edge-descriptors}




\index{Edge descriptor








An edge descriptor is a handle to an edge within a graph.
 They are similar to vertex descriptors (chapter 
\ref{subsec:Vertex-descriptors}



).
 



Edge descriptors are used to obtain the name, or other properties, of an
 edge



In this tutorial, edge descriptors have named prefixed with \verb;ed_'
\index{ed_




, for example \verb;ed_1'.

\subsection{Get all edge descriptors}

\index{Edge descriptors, get





\index{Get edge descriptors








Obtaining all edge descriptors is similar to obtaining all vertex descriptors
 (algorithm 
\ref{lst:get_vertex_descriptors}



), as shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:get_edge_descriptors}



:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:

Get all edge descriptors of a graph
\index{Get edge descriptors





\label{lst:get_edge_descriptors}

















The only difference is that instead of the function \verb;vertices; (not boost::verti
ces
\index{boost::vertices does not exist




!), \verb;edges;
\index{edges




 (not boost::edges
\index{boost::edges does not exist




!) is used.
 



Listing 
\ref{lst:get_edge_descriptors_demo}



 demonstrates the \verb;get_edge_descriptor', by showing that empty graphs do
 not have any edge descriptors.

This directed graph is a two-state Markov chain, with two vertices and four

Note that directed graphs can have edges that start and end in the same
 vertex.
 These are called self-loops.


\begin_layout Subsubsection

To create this two-state Markov chain, the following code can be used:

\index{Create Markov chain





\label{lst:create_markov_chain_graph}

















Instead of typing the complete type, we call the \verb;create_empty_directed_graph;
 function, and let auto figure out the type.
 The vertex descriptors (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:Vertex-descriptors}



) created by two \verb;boost::add_vertex;
\index{boost::add_vertex




 calls are stored to add an edge to the graph.
 Then \verb;boost::add_edge;
\index{boost::add_edge




 is called four times.
 Every time, its return type (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:boost::add_edge result}



) is checked for a successful insertion.



Note that the graph lacks all properties: nodes do not have names, nor do
 edges.


\begin_layout Subsubsection
Creating such a graph



Listing 
\ref{create_markov_chain_demo}



 demonstrates the \verb;create_markov_chain_graph' function and checks if it

Running a bit ahead, this graph can be converted to a .dot file using the
 \verb;save_graph_to_dot' function (algorithm

\label{lst:create_markov_chain.dot}

















From the .dot file one can already see that the graph is directed, because:


\begin{itemize}
The first word, \verb;digraph', denotes a directed graph (where \verb;graph' would
 have indicated an undirected graph)


\begin{itemize}
The edges are written as \verb;->' (where undirected connections would be written

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Getting the vertices' out degree}
\label{subsec:get_vertex_out_degrees}







Let's measure the out degree of all vertices in a graph! 



The out degree of a vertex is the number of edges that originate at it.
 



The number of connections is called the \verb;degree' of the vertex.
 There are three types of degrees:


\begin{itemize}
in degree: the number of incoming connections, using \verb;in_degree'
\index{in_degree




 (not \verb;boost::in_degree'
\index{boost::in_degree does not exist




)


\begin{itemize}
out degree: the number of outgoing connections, using \verb;out_degree'
\index{out_degree




 (not \verb;boost::out_degree'
\index{boost::out_degree does not exist




)


\begin{itemize}
degree: sum of the in degree and out degree, using \verb;degree'
\index{idegree




 (not \verb;boost::degree'
\index{boost::degree does not exist




)



Listing 
\ref{lst:get_vertex_out_degrees}



 shows how to obtain these:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{get_vertex_out_degrees.impl}











Get the vertices' out degrees
\index{Get vertex out degrees





\label{lst:get_vertex_out_degrees}

















The structure of this algorithm is similar to \verb;get_vertex_descriptors' (algorith
m 
\ref{lst:get_vertex_descriptors}



), except that the out degrees from the vertex descriptors are stored.
 The out degree of a vertex iterator is obtained from the function \verb;out_degree'
\index{out_degree




 (not boost::out_degree
\index{boost::out_degree does not exist




!).
 



Albeit that the 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$


 graph and the two-state Markov chain are rather simple, we can use it to
 demonstrate \verb;get_vertex_out_degrees' on, as shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:get_vertex_out_degrees_demo}



.






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{get_vertex_out_degrees_demo.impl}











Demonstration of the \verb;get_vertex_out_degrees' function
\label{lst:get_vertex_out_degrees_demo}

















It is expected that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$


 has one out-degree for every vertex, where the two-state Markov chain is
 expected to have two out-degrees per vertex.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\triangle$ Is there an edge between two vertices?}
\label{subsec:has_edge_between_vertices}







If you have two vertex descriptors, you can check if these are connected
 by an edge:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{has_edge_between_vertices.impl}











Check if there exists an edge between two vertices
\index{Has edge between vertices





\label{lst:has_edge_between_vertices}

















This code uses the function \verb;edge'
\index{edge




 (not boost::edge
\index{boost::edge does not exist




: it returns a pair consisting of an edge descriptor and a boolean indicating
 if it is a valid edge descriptor.
 The boolean will be true if there exists an edge between the two vertices
 and false if not.



The demo shows that there is an edge between the two vertices of a 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$


 graph, but there are no self-loops (edges that original and end at the
 same vertex).

  caption = ,

\subsection{$\triangle$$\triangle$ Create a direct-neighbour subgraph from a vertex descriptor}
\label{subsec:create_direct_neighbour_subgraph}







Suppose you have a vertex of interest its vertex descriptor.
 Let's say you want to get a subgraph of that vertex and its direct neighbours
 only.
 This means that all vertices of that subgraph are adjacent vertices and
 that the edges go either from focal vertex to its neighbours, or from adjacent
 vertex to adjacent neighbour.



Here is the \verb;create_direct_neighbour_subgraph' code:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{create_direct_neighbour_subgraph.impl}











Get the direct-neighbour subgraph from a vertex descriptor
\index{Create direct-neighbour subgraph





\label{lst:create_direct_neighbour_subgraph}

It does so, by collecting the neighbours of the traversed vertices.
 Each sweep, all neighbours of traversed neighbours are added to a set of

 Then an empty directed graph is created, which saves us writing down the

\section{...}
Building graphs with bundled vertices
\label{sec:Building-graphs-with-bundled-vertices}







Up until now, the graphs created have had edges and vertices without any
 properties.
 In this chapter, graphs will be created, in which the vertices can have
 a bundled \verb;my_bundled_vertex' type
\footnote{I do not intend to be original in naming my data types




.
 The following graphs will be created:


\begin{itemize}
An empty directed graph that allows for bundled vertices: see chapter 
\ref{lst:create_empty_directed_bundled_vertices_graph}






\begin{itemize}
An empty undirected graph that allows for bundled vertices: see chapter
 
\ref{subsec:create_empty_directed_bundled_vertices_graph}






\begin{itemize}
A two-state Markov chain with bundled vertices: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_bundled_vertices_markov_chain}






\begin{itemize}
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$


with bundled vertices: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_bundled_vertices_k2_graph}







In the process, some basic (sometimes bordering trivial) functions are shown:


\begin{itemize}
Create the vertex class, called \verb;my_bundled_vertex': see chapter 
\ref{subsec:my_bundled_vertex}






\begin{itemize}
Adding a \verb;my_bundled_vertex': see chapter 
\ref{subsec:add_bundled_vertex}






\begin{itemize}
Getting the vertices \verb;my_bundled_vertex'-es: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:get_bundled_vertex_my_vertexes}







These functions are mostly there for completion and showing which data types
 are used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Creating the bundled vertex class}
\label{subsec:my_bundled_vertex}







Before creating an empty graph with bundled vertices, that bundled vertex
 class must be created.
 In this tutorial, it is called \verb;my_bundled_vertex'.
 \verb;my_bundled_vertex' is a class that is nonsensical, but it can be replaced
 by any other class type.



Here I will show the header file of \verb;my_bundled_vertex', as the implementation
 of it is not important:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{my_bundled_vertex.impl}











Declaration of my_bundled_vertex
\index{my_bundled_vertex





\index{my_bundled_vertex.h





\index{my_vertex declaration





\index{Declaration, my_bundled_vertex 





\label{lst:my_bundled_vertex_h}

















\verb;my_bundled_vertex' is a class that has multiple properties: 


\begin{itemize}
It has four public member variables: the double \verb;m_x' (\verb;m_
\index{m_




' stands for member
\index{member




), the double \verb;m_y', the std::string m_name and the std::string m_description.
 These variables must be public


\begin{itemize}
It has a default constructor


\begin{itemize}
It is copyable


\begin{itemize}
It is comparable for equality (it has operator==), which is needed for searching



\verb;my_bundled_vertex' does not have to have the stream operators defined for
 file I/O, as this goes via the public member variables.

\begin{itemize}
has its vertices stored in a std::vector (due to the second boost::vecS
\index{boost::vecS




)


\begin{itemize}
is directed (due to the boost::directedS
\index{boost::directedS




)


\begin{itemize}
The vertices have one property: they have a bundled type, that is of data
 type \verb;my_bundled_vertex'


\begin{itemize}
The edges and graph have no properties


\begin{itemize}
Edges are stored in a std::list



The \verb;boost::adjacency_list; has a new, fourth template argument \verb;my_bundled_vertex
\index{my_bundled_vertex




'.
 This can be read as: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld


vertices have the bundled property \verb;my_bundled_vertex'
\begin_inset Quotes erd


.
 Or simply: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld


vertices have a bundled type called my_bundled_vertex

\index{Add bundled vertex





\label{lst:add_bundled_vertex}

















When having added a new (abstract) vertex to the graph, the vertex descriptor
 is used to set the \verb;my_bundled_vertex' in the graph.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Getting the bundled vertices' my_vertexes}

\footnote{the name \verb;my_vertexes' is chosen to indicate this function returns a container
 of my_vertex





\label{subsec:get_bundled_vertex_my_vertexes}







When the vertices of a graph have any bundled \verb;my_bundled_vertex', one can
 extract these as such:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{get_my_bundled_vertexes.impl}











Get the bundled vertices' my_vertexes
\index{Get bundled vertex my_vertexes





\label{lst:get_my_bundled_vertexes}

















The \verb;my_bundled_vertex' bundled in each vertex is obtained from a vertex
 descriptor and then put into a std::vector.



The order of the \verb;my_bundled_vertex' objects may be different after saving
 and loading.



When trying to get the vertices' my_bundled_vertex from a graph without
 these, you will get the error \verb;formed reference to void' (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:formed_reference_to_void}



).

\subsection{Has a bundled vertex with a my_bundled_vertex}
\label{subsec:has_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex}







Before modifying our vertices, let's first determine if we can find a vertex
 by its bundled type (\verb;my_bundled_vertex') in a graph.
 After obtain the vertex iterators, we can dereference each these to obtain
 the vertex descriptors and then compare each vertex its \verb;my_bundled_vertex'
 with the one desired.

  label = lst:

This function can be demonstrated as in algorithm 
\ref{lst:has_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex_demo}



, where a certain my_bundled_vertex cannot be found in an empty graph.
 After adding the desired my_bundled_vertex, it is found.

Note that this function only finds if there is at least one bundled vertex
 with that my_bundled_vertex: it does not tell how many bundled vertices
 with that my_bundled_vertex exist in the graph.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Find a bundled vertex with a certain my_bundled_vertex}
\label{subsec:find_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex}







Where STL functions work with iterators, here we obtain a vertex descriptor
 (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:Vertex-descriptors}



) to obtain a handle to the desired vertex.
 Listing 
\ref{lst:find_first_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex}



 shows how to obtain a vertex descriptor to the first vertex found with
 a specific \verb;my_bundled_vertex' value.

With the vertex descriptor obtained, one can read and modify the vertex
 and the edges surrounding it.
 Listing 
\ref{lst:find_first_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex_demo}



 shows some examples of how to do so.

) to produce a

Mapping of my_bundled_vertex member variable and Graphviz attributes
\label{tab:Mapping-of-my_bundled_vertex-to-Graphviz-attributes}

















Important in this mapping is that the C++ and the Graphviz data types match.
 I also chose attributes that matched as closely as possible.



The writer also encodes the std::string of the name and description to a
 Graphviz-friendly format.
 When loading the .dot file again, this will have to be undone again.

\subsection{Loading a directed graph with bundled vertices from a .dot}
\label{subsec:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}







When loading a graph from file, one needs to specify a type of graph.
 In this example, an directed graph with bundled vertices is loaded, as
 shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}



:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot.impl}











Loading a directed graph with bundled vertices from a .dot file
\index{Load directed bundled vertices graph from dot





\label{lst:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}

















In this algorithm, first it is checked if the file to load exists.
 Then an empty directed graph is created, to save typing the typename explicitly.



Then a boost::dynamic_properties
\index{boost::dynamic_properties




 is created with its default constructor, after which we set it to follow
 the same mapping as in the previous chapter.
 From this and the empty graph, \verb;boost::read_graphviz'
\index{boost::read_graphviz




 is called to build up the graph.



At the moment the graph is created, all \verb;my_bundled_vertex' their names
 and description are in a Graphviz-friendly format.
 By obtaining all vertex iterators and vertex descriptors, the encoding
 is made undone.



Listing 
\ref{lst:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot_demo}



 shows how to use the \verb;load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot' function:

\subsection{Loading an undirected graph with bundled vertices from a .dot}
\label{subsec:load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}







When loading a graph from file, one needs to specify a type of graph.
 In this example, an undirected graph with bundled vertices is loaded, as
 shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}



:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,

\label{lst:load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}

















The only difference with loading a directed graph, is that the initial empty
 graph is undirected instead.
 Chapter 
\ref{subsec:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}



 describes the rationale of this function.
 



Listing 
\ref{lst:load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot_demo}



 shows how to use the \verb;load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot'
 function:

 The loaded graph is checked to be the same as the original.


\section{...}
Building graphs with bundled edges and vertices



Up until now, the graphs created have had only bundled vertices.
 In this chapter, graphs will be created, in which both the edges and vertices
 have a bundled \verb;my_bundled_edge' and \verb;my_bundled_edge' type
\footnote{I do not intend to be original in naming my data types




.


\begin{itemize}
An empty directed graph that allows for bundled edges and vertices: see
 chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_empty_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph}






\begin{itemize}
An empty undirected graph that allows for bundled edges and vertices: see
 chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_empty_undirected_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph}






\begin{itemize}
A two-state Markov chain with bundled edges and vertices: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_bundled_edges_and_vertices_markov_chain}






\begin{itemize}
\begin_inset Formula $K_{3}$


with bundled edges and vertices: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:create_bundled_edges_and_vertices_k3}







In the process, some basic (sometimes bordering trivial) functions are shown:


\begin{itemize}
Creating the \verb;my_bundled_edge' class: see chapter 
\ref{subsec:my_bundled_edge}






\begin{itemize}
Adding a bundled \verb;my_bundled_edge': see chapter 
\ref{subsec:add_bundled_edge}







These functions are mostly there for completion and showing which data types
 are used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Creating the bundled edge class}
\label{subsec:my_bundled_edge}







In this example, I create a \verb;my_bundled_edge' class.
 Here I will show the header file of it, as the implementation of it is
 not important yet.






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{my_bundled_edge.impl}











Declaration of my_bundled_edge
\index{my_bundled_edge





\index{my_bundled_edge.h





\index{my_bundled_edge declaration





\index{Declaration, my_bundled_edge





\label{lst:my_bundled_edge_h}

















my_bundled_edge is a class that has multiple properties: two doubles \verb;m_width'
 (\verb;m_
\index{m_




' stands for member
\index{member




) and \verb;m_height', and two std::strings m_name and m_description.\verb;my_bundled_edge'
 is copyable, but cannot trivially be converted to a \verb;std::string.' \verb;my_bundled_e
dge' is comparable for equality (that is, operator== is defined).



\verb;my_bundled_edge' does not have to have the stream operators defined for
 file I/O, as this goes via the public member variables.

, except that there is a new, fifth template argument:



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



boost::property<boost::edge_bundled_type_t, my_edge>





\index{boost::property





\index{boost::edge_bundled_type_t





\index{my_edge




This can be read as: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld


edges have the property \verb;boost::edge_bundled_type_t', which is of data type
 \verb;my_bundled_edge'
\begin_inset Quotes erd


.
 Or simply: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld


edges have a bundled type called my_bundled_edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd


.

, except that the directness (the third template argument) is undirected
 (due to the boost::undirectedS

\subsection{Add a bundled edge}
\label{subsec:add_bundled_edge}







Adding a bundled edge is very similar to adding a named edge (chapter 
\ref{subsec:add_named_edge}



).

  label = lst:
]{add_bundled_edge.impl}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Getting the bundled edges my_edges}
\label{subsec:get_bundled_edge_my_edges}







When the edges of a graph are \verb;my_bundled_edge' objects, one can extract
 these all as such:






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{get_my_bundled_edges.impl}











Get the edges' my_bundled_edges
\index{Get edge my_bundled_edges





\label{lst:get_bundled_edge_my_edges}

















The \verb;my_bundled_edge' object associated with the edges are obtained from
 the graph its property_map and then put into a std::vector.



Note: the order of the my_bundled_edge objects may be different after saving
 and loading.



When trying to get the edges' my_bundled_edge objects from a graph without
 bundled edges objects associated, you will get the error \verb;formed reference
 to void' (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:formed_reference_to_void}



).

Working on graphs with bundled edges and vertices

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Has a my_bundled_edge}
\label{subsec:has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge}







Before modifying our edges, let's first determine if we can find an edge
 by its bundled type (\verb;my_bundled_edge') in a graph.
 After obtaining a my_bundled_edge map, we obtain the edge iterators, dereferenc
e these to obtain the edge descriptors and then compare each edge its my_bundled
_edge with the one desired.






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:

Find if there is a bundled edge with a certain my_bundled_edge
\index{Has bundled edge with my_bundled_edge





\label{lst:has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge}

















This function can be demonstrated as in algorithm 
\ref{lst:has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge_demo}



, where a certain \verb;my_bundled_edge' cannot be found in an empty graph.
 After adding the desired my_bundled_edge, it is found.






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge_demo.impl}











Demonstration of the \verb;has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge' function
\label{lst:has_bundled_edge_with_my_edge_demo}

















Note that this function only finds if there is at least one edge with that
 my_bundled_edge: it does not tell how many edges with that my_bundled_edge
 exist in the graph.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Find a my_bundled_edge}
\label{subsec:find_first_bundled_edge_with_my_edge}







Where STL functions work with iterators, here we obtain an edge descriptor
 (see chapter 
\ref{subsec:Edge-descriptors}



) to obtain a handle to the desired edge.
 Listing 
\ref{lst:find_first_bundled_edge_with_my_edge}



 shows how to obtain an edge descriptor to the first edge found with a specific
 my_bundled_edge value.

Find the first bundled edge with a certain my_bundled_edge
\index{Find first bundled edge with my_bundled_edge





\label{lst:find_first_bundled_edge_with_my_edge}

















With the edge descriptor obtained, one can read and modify the edge and
 the vertices surrounding it.
 Listing 
\ref{lst:find_first_bundled_edge_with_my_edge_demo}



 shows some examples of how to do so.

\subsection{Get an edge its my_bundled_edge}
\label{subsec:get_bundled_edge_my_edge}







To obtain the my_bundled_edge from an edge descriptor, one needs to pull
 out the my_bundled_edges map and then look up the my_edge of interest.

\subsection{Load a directed graph with bundled edges and vertices from a .dot file}
\label{subsec:sub:load_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}







When loading a graph from file, one needs to specify a type of graph.
 In this example, an directed graph with bundled edges and vertices is loaded,
 as shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:load_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}



:

\label{lst:load_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}

















In this algorithm, first it is checked if the file to load exists.
 Then an empty directed graph is created.
 Next to this, a boost::dynamic_properties
\index{boost::dynamic_properties




 is created with its default constructor, after which we direct the boost::dynam
ic_properties
\index{boost::dynamic_properties




 to find a \verb;node_id' and \verb;label' in the vertex name map, \verb;edge_id' and \verb;label'
 to the edge name map.
 From this and the empty graph, \verb;boost::read_graphviz'
\index{boost::read_graphviz




 is called to build up the graph.



Listing 
\ref{lst:load_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot_demo}

\index{Load undirected graph with bundled edges and vertices from .dot





\index{Create undirected graph with bundled edges and vertices from .dot








When loading a graph from file, one needs to specify a type of graph.
 In this example, an undirected graph with bundled edges and vertices is
 loaded, as shown in algorithm 
\ref{lst:load_undirected_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}



:

\label{lst:load_undirected_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}

















The only difference with loading a directed graph, is that the initial empty
 graph is undirected instead.
 Chapter 
\ref{subsec:sub:load_directed_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot}



 describes the rationale of this function.
 



Listing 
\ref{lst:load_undirected_bundled_edges_and_vertices_graph_from_dot_demo}

 with bundled vertices is created using the \verb;create_bundled_vertices_k2_graph'
 function (algorithm

 The loaded graph is checked to be a graph similar to the original.

Building graphs with a graph name
\label{sec:Building-graphs-with-a-graph-name}







Up until now, the graphs created have had no properties themselves.
 Sure, the edges and vertices have had properties, but the graph itself
 has had none.
 Until now.



In this chapter, graphs will be created with a graph name of type std::string


\begin{itemize}
An empty directed graph with a graph name: see chapter

\begin{itemize}
A two-state Markov chain with a graph name: see chapter


\begin{itemize}

 (\verb;Scalable Vector Graphic') file.
 This function assumes the program \verb;dot' is installed, which is part of
 Graphviz.

Convert a .dot file to a .svg
\index{Convert dot to svg





\label{lst:convert_dot_to_svg}

















\verb;convert_dot_to_svg' makes a system call to the program \verb;dot' to convert
 the .dot file to an .svg file.

Errors



Some common errors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Formed reference to void}
\label{subsec:formed_reference_to_void}







This compile-time error occurs when you create a graph without a certain
 property, then subsequently reading that property, as in algorithm 
\ref{lst:formed_reference_to_void}



: 






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{formed_reference_to_void.impl}











Creating the error \verb;formed reference to void'
\index{Formed reference to void





\label{lst:formed_reference_to_void}

















In algorithm 
\ref{lst:formed_reference_to_void}



 a graph is created with vertices of no properties.
 Then the names of these vertices, which do not exists, are tried to be
 read.
 If you want to read the names of the vertices, supply a graph that has
 this property.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{No matching function for call to \verb;;clear_out_edges;}
\label{subsec:no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_out_edges}







This compile-time error occurs when you want to clear the outward edges
 from a vertex in an undirected graph.
 






\lstinputlisting[
  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_out_edges.impl}











Creating the error \verb;no matching function for call to clear_out_edges'
\index{No matching function for call to clear_out_edges





\label{lst:no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_out_edges}

















In algorithm 
\ref{lst:no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_out_edges}



an undirected graph is created, a vertex descriptor is obtained, then itsout
 edges are tried to be cleared.Either use a directed graph (which has out
 edges), or use the \verb;boost::clear_vertex' function instead.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{No matching function for call to \verb;clear_in_edges;}
\label{subsec:no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_in_edges}







See chapter 
\ref{subsec:no_matching_function_for_call_to_clear_out_edges}



.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Undefined reference to boost::detail::graph::read_graphviz_new}
\label{subsec:undefined_reference_to_read_graphviz_new}




\index{read_graphviz_new





\index{Undefined reference to read_graphviz_new





\index{read_graphviz_new, undefined reference








You will have to link
\index{link




 against the Boost.Graph and Boost.Regex libraries.
 In Qt Creator, this is achieved by adding these lines to your Qt Creator
 project file:



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



LIBS += -lboost_graph -lboost_regex

\subsection{Property not found: node_id}
\label{subsec:property_not_found_node_id}




\index{node_id





\index{Property not found





\index{Property not found: node_id








When loading a graph from file (as in chapter 
\ref{subsec:load_undirected_graph_from_dot}



) you will be using boost::read_graphviz
\index{boost::read_graphviz




.
 boost::read_graphviz
\index{boost::read_graphviz




 needs a third argument, of type boost::dynamic_properties
\index{boost::dynamic_properties




.
 When a graph does not have properties, do not use a default constructed
 version, but initialize with \verb;boost::ignore_other_properties'
\index{boost::ignore_other_properties




 as a constructor argument instead.
 Listing 
\ref{lst:property_not_found_node_id}



 shows how to trigger this run-time error.

  caption = ,
  label = lst:
]{property_not_found_node_id.impl}

\label{lst:property_not_found_node_id}















%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Stream zeroes}

When loading a graph from a .dot file, in operator>>, I encountered reading
 zeroes, where I expected an XML formatted string:



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



std::istream& ribi::cmap::operator>>(std::istream& is, my_class& any_class)
 noexcept




{




  std::string s;




  is >> s; //s has an XML format




  \verb;assert;(s != }0});




  any_class = my_class(s);




  return is;




}








This was because I misconfigured the reader.
 I did (heavily simplified code):



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



graph load_from_dot(const std::string& dot_filename)




{




  std::ifstream f(dot_filename);




  graph g;




  boost::dynamic_properties dp;




  dp.property(}node_id}, get(boost::vertex_custom_type, g));




  dp.property(}label}, get(boost::vertex_custom_type, g));




  boost::read_graphviz(f,g,dp);




  return g;




}








Where it should have been:



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



graph load_from_dot(const std::string& dot_filename)




{




  std::ifstream f(dot_filename);




  graph g;




  boost::dynamic_properties dp(boost::ignore_other_properties);




  dp.property(}label}, get(boost::vertex_custom_type, g));




  boost::read_graphviz(f,g,dp);




  return g;




}








The explanation is that by setting the boost::dynamic_property \verb;node_id'
 to \verb;boost::vertex_custom_type', operator>> will receive the node indices.
 



An alternative, but less clean solution, is to let operator>> ignore the
 node indices:



\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open



std::istream& ribi::cmap::operator>>(std::istream& is, my_class& any_class)
 noexcept




{




  std::string s;




  is >> s; //s has an XML format




  if (!is_xml(s)) { //Ignore node index




    any_class_class = my_class(); 




  }




  else {




    any_class_class = my_class(s);




  }




  return is;




}
