\chapter{Misc functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These are some function I needed for creating this tutorial.
Although they are not important for working with graphs, I used these heavily.
These functions may be compiler-dependent, platform-dependent and/or there
may be superior alternatives.
I just add them for completeness.

This function will only work under GCC.
I found this code at 
\url{
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1055452/c-get-name-of-type-in-template
}.
