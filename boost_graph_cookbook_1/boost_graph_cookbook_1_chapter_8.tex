\chapter{Building graphs with a graph name}
\label{sec:Building-graphs-with-a-graph-name}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Up until now, the graphs created have had no properties themselves.
Sure, the edges and vertices have had properties, but the graph itself
has had none.
Until now.

In this chapter, graphs will be created with a graph name of type std::string

\begin{itemize}
  \item An empty directed graph with a graph name: 
    see chapter 
  \item An empty undirected graph with a graph name: 
    see chapter 
  \item A two-state Markov chain with a graph name: 
    see chapter
  \item $K_{3}$ with a graph name: 
   see chapter 
\end{itemize}

In the process, some basic (sometimes bordering trivial) functions are shown:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Getting a graph its name: 
    see chapter 
  \item Setting a graph its name: 
    see chapter
\end{itemize}
