Now that we can build a graph, there are some things we can do.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Getting the vertices' out degrees: 
    see chapter \ref{subsec:get_vertex_out_degrees}
  \item
    Create a direct-neighbour subgraph from a vertex descriptor
  \item
    Create all direct-neighbour subgraphs from a graphs
  \item
    Saving a graph without properties to .dot file: 
    see chapter \ref{subsec:save_graph_to_dot}
  \item
    Loading an undirected graph without properties from .dot file: 
    see chapter \ref{subsec:load_undirected_graph_from_dot}
  \item
    Loading a directed graph without properties from .dot file: 
    see chapter \ref{subsec:load_directed_graph_from_dot}
\end{itemize}
