When using graphs with bundled vertices, their state gives a way to find
a vertex and working with it.
This chapter shows some basic operations on graphs with bundled vertices.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Check if there exists a vertex with a certain \verb;my_bundled_vertex;: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:has_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex}
  \item Find a vertex with a certain \verb;my_bundled_vertex;: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:find_bundled_vertex_with_my_vertex}
  \item Get a vertex its \verb;my_bundled_vertex; from its vertex descriptor: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:get_bundled_vertex_my_vertex}
  \item Set a vertex its \verb;my_bundled_vertex; using its vertex descriptor: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:set_bundled_vertex_my_vertex}
  \item Setting all vertices their \verb;my_bundled_vertex;-es: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:set_bundled_vertex_my_vertexes}
  \item Storing an directed/undirected graph with bundled vertices as a .dot file: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:save_bundled_vertices_graph_to_dot}
  \item Loading a directed graph with bundled vertices from a .dot file: 
    chapter \ref{subsec:load_directed_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}
  \item Loading an undirected directed graph with bundled vertices from a .dot file:
    chapter \ref{subsec:load_undirected_bundled_vertices_graph_from_dot}
\end{itemize}
