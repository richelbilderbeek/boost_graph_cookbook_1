Richèl Bilderbeek is a C++ developer with more than 20 years of experience,
that has produced dozens of libraries, 
academic simulations, tools and games.

Richèl started programming in GW-BASIC as an 8-year old kid and at age 15
he thaught he was the best programmer in the world, which is a common
teenager's misconception. At the age of 20, his C++ journal started 
at the University of Groningen, where he developed a simulation
about earthworms' mating strategies, called 'Sex and Suffering'.
The perception of his own skills changed dramatically when he started to
read the literature, such as 'The Pragmatic Programmer', 'The Clean Coder',
'C++ Coding Standards', 'Effective C++' and many more.
Since then, Richèl enjoys to follow the C++ literature and its best practices, 
both when coding himself and when teaching others.
He cares about code quality, because he cares about people. 
And he cares about teaching for the same reason.
The goal of writing this book is to give his fellow C++ programmers
an introduction to the Boost.Graph library with a more gentle learning
curve, while using the best C++ practices.

## SUBJECT MATTER OF BOOK

> * Title: In order that your title will be found on Amazon, 
> please choose search-engine optimized (SEO) compatible keywords 
> especially for the main title (max. 55 characters),

> Choose keywords you think people will use when searching ideas 
> and topics in your content).

Boost.Graph Cookbook 1: Basics

### B. EDITED OR AUTHORED?*

> Edited works contain contributed works from other authors. 
> The editor(s) may also contribute to the book as an author. 
> Authored works are only authored by the listed main authors 
> and contain no contributions from other parties. 

Please indicate below whether your book will be authored or edited.
Authored: No     Edited: Yes

Number (approximate): 4

### C. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK: 

> maximum 450 characters including spaces (please note
> that it is 450 characters not 450 words!): 
> This text will be printed in our new releases and in booksellers’ catalogues 
> and may serve as a basis for the back-cover text. 
> The text should provide the reader with a quick overview 
> of your book’s subject matter and the relevance of your topic or approach. 
> Short texts are not just read by scholars, specialists and professionals but also potentially by librarians and booksellers who are strangers to your subject. Therefore, please ensure that your text is as clear as possible. We reserve the right to modify your text before it is published.

This book is the first to introduce the reader
to the complex, powerful, useful and well-known Boost.Graph C++ library
in a pedagogic and pragmatic way.

This book, called 'Boost.Graph Cookbook 1: Basics', follows a 'cookbook' style,
that orders its items in chronologically logical fashion,
increasing the complexity gradually,
while showing complete pieces of code.

#### Introductory sentence: reason for publication 

The Boost.Graph library is a cutting-edge C++ library to work with graphs.

Graphs are powerful data structures, consisting of points (called vertices)
and lines connecting them (called edges)
with broad applications, such as the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem.
The Boost.Library is a library that allows one to work with graphs in C++.
This powerful library makes heavy use of templates and may be complex to get
started with.

This book allows one to use Boost.Graph quickly and in with a gentle learning
curve, while following the C++ best practices.
