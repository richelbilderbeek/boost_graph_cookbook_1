Richel Bilderbeek is a C++ developer with more than 20 years of experience,
that has produced dozens of academic tools and (non-academic) games.

Richel enjoys following the C++ literature and tries to follow
all of the best practices, both when coding himself and when teaching others.
He cares about code quality, because he cares about people. 
And he cares about teaching for the same reason.
The goal of writing this book is to give my students/colleagues a better introduction to the Boost.Graph library.

## SUBJECT MATTER OF BOOK

### A. PLANNED BOOK TITLE AND SUBTITLE:

> * Title: In order that your title will be found on Amazon, 
> please choose search-engine optimized (SEO) compatible keywords 
> especially for the main title (max. 55 characters),

> It is important to make this right from the beginning. 
> (SEO keywords are words and phrases people type into search engines – e.g.: 
> Google and Amazon – to find out about a subject. 
> Choose keywords you think people will use when searching ideas 
> and topics in your content).

Boost.Graph Cookbook 1: Basics

### B. EDITED OR AUTHORED?*

> Edited works contain contributed works from other authors. 
> The editor(s) may also contribute to the book as an author. 
> Authored works are only authored by the listed main authors 
> and contain no contributions from other parties. 

Please indicate below whether your book will be authored or edited.
Authored: No     Edited: Yes

> For edited volumes, please indicate the approximate number of contributors.

Number (approximate): 4

### C. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK: 

> maximum 450 characters including spaces (please note
> that it is 450 characters not 450 words!): 
> This text will be printed in our new releases and in booksellers’ catalogues 
> and may serve as a basis for the back-cover text. 
> The text should provide the reader with a quick overview 
> of your book’s subject matter and the relevance of your topic or approach. 
> Short texts are not just read by scholars, specialists and professionals but also potentially by librarians and booksellers who are strangers to your subject. Therefore, please ensure that your text is as clear as possible. We reserve the right to modify your text before it is published.

This book is the first to introduce the reader
to the complex (yet powerful, useful and well known) Boost.Graph C++ library
in a pedagogic and pragmatic way.

This book, called 'Boost.Graph Cookbook 1: Basics', follows a 'cookbook' style,
that orders its items in chronologically logical fashion,
increasing the complexity gradually,
while showing complete pieces of code.

Graphs are powerful data structures, consisting of points (called vertices)
and lines connecting them (called edges)
with broad applications, such as the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem.
